Tenders Project Status - 27 Sep 2025 (Updated)
===================================

Completed Work
--------------
- Frontend scaffolding using Next.js + shadcn UI (projects list, detail, match, assessment views).
- DynamoDB repositories & list APIs for sections, ITT items, response items, matches, and exceptions wired into project handlers.
- **Excel extraction pipeline with full hierarchy support**: AI-assisted parser performs multi-pass hierarchy detection, normalises section and sub-section codes/names, and handles natural sorting for item codes (1.1.1, 1.1.10, etc.).
- **Enhanced contractor response extraction**: Robust Excel processing with worksheet detection, header synonym mapping, data corruption filtering, note/comment exclusion, and improved quantity/pricing data extraction.
- **Database schema enhancements**: ITTItem entities now include hierarchy fields (sectionName, subSectionCode, subSectionName) with updated repositories and API responses.
- **Frontend ITT items improvements**: Text filtering across item codes/descriptions/sections, natural sorting algorithm for hierarchical codes, clean hierarchy display format ("5. Preliminaries → 1.1 Establishment"), and sortable, resizable columns on the document detail view.
- **Real-world testing completed**: ITT.xlsx extraction validated with 125 line items across 11 sections and 30 sub-sections successfully processed.
- **Complete Auto-Match System**: Sophisticated matching engine with exact/fuzzy algorithms, confidence scoring, unit equivalence checking, section-based boosting, and SQS-driven async processing.
- **Advanced Match API**: Full CRUD operations including list/filter matches, update status with conflict detection, create manual matches, bulk accept with atomic transactions, and auto-match triggers.
- **Match Suggestions Interface**: Focused review screen showing 100% confidence suggestions by default, live statistics, bulk operations, resizable columns, conflict handling, and comment capture for lower-confidence actions.
- **Manual Matching UI**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating manual matches with ITT items and response items.
- **Complete Assessment System**: Data aggregation across contractors/sections, total calculations, exception handling, and structured reporting data.
- **Assessment Frontend**: Section-by-section comparison tables, contractor summaries, exception display, and PDF generation integration.
- **Quantity/Rate/Unit Display**: Complete contractor response information visibility across match review tables and DND panels.
- React Query data hooks wired to API client; upload UI flows using presigned URLs.
- AWS CDK stacks for Auth, Storage (S3 + SQS notifications), Data (DynamoDB), AI (extractor/matcher/report queues), and API (LambdaRestApi with CORS).
- Core project repository in services layer (create/list/get/update/delete with owner scoping) plus shared Dynamo client/env helpers.
- API gateway Lambda routing with CORS handling and project summary endpoints (detail, ITT items, response items, exceptions).
- Document, contractor, and parse job repositories and mapping utilities for DynamoDB single-table layout.
- Upload API handlers performing presigned POST generation, document/contractor persistence, and parse job enqueueing.
- Environment variable validation fixes for Lambda deployment (queue URLs made optional).
- Extract/match/report Lambdas deployed with CDK wiring and Excel extraction fully functional.
- Amplify hosting connected to GitHub; latest build triggered after backend deploy.
- Unit tests for mappers (Vitest) and lint passes front/back.
- Recent CDK deploy with updated Lambda bundles; manual smoke checks on extraction pipeline.

Outstanding / Next Steps
------------------------
1. PDF Extraction Pipeline
   - **PRIORITY**: Implement PDF extractor + Textract integration for contractor response documents.
   - Currently only Excel responses are supported; PDF capability needed for complete solution.
   - Infrastructure exists; needs Textract service integration in extract/pdf.ts handler.

2. Report Generation System
   - Implement PDF report generation using Puppeteer for assessment summaries.
   - Assessment API provides structured data; needs PDF rendering and S3 artifact storage.
   - Report generation Lambda exists but needs implementation.

3. Exception Management
   - Complete exception repository write/update operations.
   - Implement exception attachment to sections via API endpoints.
   - Frontend exception management UI (partially implemented).

4. Authentication & Security
   - **CRITICAL**: Hook Cognito authorizer/JWT validation into API Gateway (replace `DEFAULT_OWNER_SUB` fallback).
   - Ensure Amplify frontend retrieves tokens and attaches Authorization headers.
   - Review IAM policies for least privilege (S3/DynamoDB/SQS/Textract).

5. Advanced Features
   - Match removal/unmatching functionality (infrastructure exists).
   - Enhanced bulk operations with progress tracking.
   - Advanced reporting and analytics capabilities.
   - Normalisation of contractor response hierarchy back to ITT sections/sub-sections for consistent UI display.

6. Testing & QA
   - Expand unit coverage for repositories, API handlers, and match logic.
   - Add integration tests (Vitest or Jest) for key workflows.
   - ✅ COMPLETED: Real-world validation with ITT.xlsx (125 items, 11 sections, 30 sub-sections).
   - Plan end-to-end validation: run complete response->extraction->matching->assessment workflow.

7. DevOps / Tooling
   - Consider adding GitHub Actions for lint/test/build + CDK deploy.
   - Add environment variable management (`.env.local`, secrets) documenting required values.
   - Monitor Amplify/Cognito configuration and update README with deployment steps.
